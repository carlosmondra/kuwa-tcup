  <p>This file simulates the Poker protocol implemented via the KuwaRegistration.sol, QualifiedKuwaRegistrar.sol,
and KuwaToken.sol smart contracts by using web3js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>This simulation is very simple and only tests the beginning phase of the Poker protocol.
Future implementations will give losing Registrars the ability to to challenge a majority vote:</p>
<p>There are three Registrars.
Each Registrar bets 1 Kuwa Token on a KR.
The KR’s Sponsor also contributes 1 Kuwa Token (transaction fee or incentive ante).
Pot = 4 Kuwa Tokens (3 from the Registrars, and 1 from the Sponsor)
Registrars 	#1 and #2 vote that a KR is invalid.
Registrar 	#3 votes that a KR is valid.
Registrars 	#1 and #2 “win” since they are in the majority. Registrar #3 has lost.
Registrars 	#1 and #2 split the pot They get 2 Kuwa Tokens each (net profit of 1 Kuwa Token each).
Registrar 	#3 (the loser) gets nothing (net loss of 1 Kuwa Token).</p>
<p> In this simulation, Registrars #1 and #2 are Alice and Bob, Registrar #3 is Carlos.
Registrars vote by providing the keccak256 hash of their vote (0 or 1) and a salt (a random bytes32 value).
After the first valid vote is cast, other Registrars have 1 hour to vote.
After the voting process ends, Registrars are required to reveal their votes within 1 hour by providing the original vote and salt.
The hash of these two values must match the committed vote provided during the voting process for the Registrar or voter to be deemed honest.
After the reveal process ends, the Sponsor decides the majority vote which then becomes the final status of the Kuwa client.
The winning Registrars are then responsible for claiming their reward.</p>
<p> This file requires the 'wallet.json' configuration file and the './keystore' directory to run the simulation.
'./wallets.json' contains the public Ethereum wallet addresses of all the participants in the simulation
'./keystore' directory contains information to import the private keys of these participants (using keythereum)</p>
