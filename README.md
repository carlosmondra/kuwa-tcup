# The Crypto UBI Project (TCUP)

We are developing a cryptocurrency "faucet" to deliver a universal basic income (UBI). As part of the project, we will implement the Kuwa identity sytem.
A high level description of the project can be found [here](http://www.kuwa.org/Kuwa-Driven_Basic_Income_Faucet.pdf).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
sudo apt-get install npm```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
