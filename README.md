# The Crypto UBI Project (TCUP)

This repository contains the Kuwa Identity Platform and The Crypto Universal Basic Income Project (TCUP, which we pronounce "teacup"). [The Kuwa Foundation](http://kuwa.org) the [University of Massachusetts Amherst Center for Data Science (CDS)](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/) initially developed this software as part of the CDS's Data Science for the Common Good program.

**IMPORTANT: This software comes with no warranties and is highly experimental. You should not use it in any non-experimental application, and especially not use it in an application that could risk something of value. USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

We are developing a cryptocurrency "faucet" to deliver a universal basic income (UBI). As part of the project, we will implement the Kuwa identity system.
A high-level description of the project can be found [here](http://www.kuwa.org/Kuwa-Driven_Basic_Income_Faucet.pdf).
